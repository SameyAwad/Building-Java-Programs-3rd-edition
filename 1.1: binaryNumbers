Why do computers use binary numbers?
-  It makes the computer faster and more efficient than other number bases.
-  At the time when computers were invented, humans only knew about the numbers 0 and 1.
-  Because there are 10 types of people: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.
+  It is impossible to build a computer that uses a different number base than binary.
-  It is easier to build electronic devices reliably if they only have to distinguish between two electric states.
