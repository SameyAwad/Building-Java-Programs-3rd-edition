In your own words, describe an algorithm for baking cookies. 
Assume that you have a large number of hungry friends,
so you'll want to produce several batches of cookies!
 
1- Make a list of hungry friends, get count
2- Buy sugar, flour, eggs, yeast, milk
3- check capacity of oven,baking sheets, and mixer
4- calculate number of batches based on friends count
5- mix the first batch
6- bake it
7- repeat step 5 and 6 until all friends are served
